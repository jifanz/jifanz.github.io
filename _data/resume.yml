    ***This section is a brief summary of my past and retired bios***

    > I was born in [Shenyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang), China and my family moved to [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing) when I was [2 years old](/Jifan-2-year-old.jpg){:target="_blank"}. I came to the states for [high school](https://www.prismsus.org/) back in 2013.\

    > In springs of 2021 and 2019, I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in computer science from the University of Washignton. During undergrad, I had somewhat broad academic interests, such as Computer Vision, Robotics, Functional Programming and Math & CS Problem Solving.\
    
    > From 2019 to 2021, I was advised by [Kevin Jamieson](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html), working on problems in active learning and multi-armed bandits. I worked in the [RSE Lab](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) from 2017 to 2019, where I researched on multi-tasking vision model for robotics perception, with [Tanner Schmidt](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tws10), under supervision of [Dieter Fox](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox). In the summer of 2018, I joined the [SAMPL group](http://sampl.cs.washington.edu/), where I was working on Relay, part of the [TVM project](https://tvm.ai/), with [Zachary Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) and [Jared Roesch](https://jroesch.github.io/).
